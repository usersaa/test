# RLMPC - Reinforcement Learning Model Predictive Control

This MATLAB implementation demonstrates the RLMPC (Reinforcement Learning Model Predictive Control) framework, which combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Model Predictive Control (MPC) through Policy Iteration (PI).

## Overview

The RLMPC framework integrates RL's ability to learn optimal policies from data with MPC's optimization-based control strategy. The core innovation is using RL to learn an optimal terminal cost function for MPC, which improves control performance without requiring explicit terminal constraints or conditions.


### Key Features

- **Policy Iteration Framework**: Alternates between policy generation (MPC) and policy evaluation (RL)
- **Online Learning**: Learns the terminal cost function while controlling the system
- **Polynomial Basis Functions**: Approximates the value function using polynomial features
- **System Support**: Implementations for both linear systems and nonlinear non-holonomic vehicle systems
- **Comparative Analysis**: Performance benchmarks against standard LQR and MPC approaches

## Algorithm

The RLMPC algorithm implements the following key steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start with a zero terminal cost function
2. **Policy Generation**: Solve MPC optimization with current value function as terminal cost
3. **Policy Evaluation**: Sample states and evaluate current policy to learn value function 
4. **Policy Improvement**: Update value function weights and use as new terminal cost
5. **Iterate**: Repeat until convergence or for a fixed number of iterations

## System Requirements

- MATLAB R2019b or later
- Optimization Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (optional, for some advanced features)

## Usage

To run the simulations:

You can select the system type by modifying the `system_type` variable in the main script:

```matlab
system_type = 'linear';    % For linear system
% OR
system_type = 'nonlinear'; % For non-holonomic vehicle
```

## Configuration Parameters

- System matrices: A = [1, 0.5; 0.1, 0.5], B = [1; 0]
- Cost matrices: Q = eye(2), R = 0.5
- Prediction horizon: N = 3
- Polynomial basis order: 2

- Regularization (lambda): 0.01

### Nonlinear Vehicle System
- State: [x, y, θ] (position and orientation)
- Input: [v, ω] (linear and angular velocity)
- Input constraints: |v| ≤ 1, |ω| ≤ 4
- State constraints: x, y bounded within [0, 2]
- Prediction horizon: N = 5 (RLMPC), N_mpc = 20 (traditional MPC)

- Learning rate (alpha): 2e-3
- Regularization (lambda): 0.01

## Implementation Details

### Learning Process
The implementation uses a hybrid approach for learning:
- **Online Learning**: The main loop implements online learning where the value function is updated at each time step as the system evolves
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: SGD is used to update the value function weights
- **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients for stable learning
- **L2 Regularization**: Prevents overfitting and stabilizes learning

### MPC Implementation
The MPC controller is implemented with several features:
- **Multiple Solvers**: Attempts different algorithms (SQP, interior-point, active-set) if optimization fails
- **Warm Starting**: Uses previous solution to initialize new optimization
- **Robust Constraints**: Handles both state and input constraints
- **Adaptive Terminal Cost**: Incorporates the learned value function as terminal cost

## Experimental Results

The implementation produces several visualizations:
- State trajectories
- Control inputs
- Accumulated costs
- Policy iteration convergence
- Weight convergence during learning
